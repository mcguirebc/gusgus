Voice Assistant

Goal here is to create a simple voice assistant using openAI APIs that can chat as well as interact with other APIs to 
do similar things as Amazon alexa including:

(1) play music via spotify
(2) play audio books via audible
(3) set timers locally
(4) tell current time locally
(5) tell weather via some API
(6) other functionality as needed

`brew install portaudio`
`aws configure --profile gusgus`
